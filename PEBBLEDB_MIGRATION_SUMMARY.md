# PebbleDB Migration Summary

## Completed Tasks ✅

### Core Implementation

- [x] **Full PebbleDB Implementation**: All SQLite-backed features now available
      in PebbleDB
  - Users, authentication, sessions, API keys
  - Dashboard preferences and layouts
  - Tags, tag associations, permissions
  - Subtitles, downloads, media items, history
  - Login tokens and role-based access control

### Build System

- [x] **Pure Go Builds**: CGO-free builds using PebbleDB (`-tags nosqlite`)
- [x] **SQLite Builds**: Traditional CGO builds with SQLite (`-tags sqlite`)
- [x] **Interface Compatibility**: Fixed ID type mapping (int64 ↔ UUID) for
      seamless operation
- [x] **Stub Implementation**: Clean sqlite_disabled.go with minimal stubs for
      unavailable features

### Testing

- [x] **Comprehensive Test Suite**: All tests pass in both build modes
- [x] **Integration Tests**: New tests verify PebbleDB core and auth
      functionality
- [x] **Migration Tests**: Proper handling when SQLite unavailable
- [x] **Backend Selection**: Tests use SubtitleStore interface with OpenStore
      factory

### Documentation

- [x] **README Updates**: Added build options and database backend configuration
- [x] **Database Selection**: Clear guidance on when to use each backend
- [x] **Build Instructions**: Step-by-step commands for both build modes

## Technical Details

### PebbleDB Features

- **No CGO Required**: Pure Go implementation, fully portable
- **High Performance**: Optimized key-value store with excellent Go integration
- **Full Feature Parity**: All authentication, user management, and data
  features
- **Smaller Binaries**: No SQLite dependencies reduce binary size
- **UUID-based IDs**: Modern identifier system with legacy compatibility

### Build Tags

- **`nosqlite` or no tags**: Pure Go build with PebbleDB (recommended)
- **`sqlite`**: CGO build with SQLite support
- **Test Commands**: `go test -tags nosqlite` and `go test -tags sqlite`

### Database Backends

- **PebbleDB**: Default for pure Go builds, directory-based storage
- **SQLite**: Traditional SQL database, file-based storage
- **PostgreSQL**: External database server (unchanged)

## Migration Path

- **Existing Users**: Can continue using SQLite builds (`-tags sqlite`)
- **New Deployments**: Recommended to use pure Go builds with PebbleDB
- **Migration Tool**: `subtitle-manager migrate old.db newdir` for data transfer

## Testing Results

```
✅ All database tests pass with -tags nosqlite
✅ All database tests pass with -tags sqlite
✅ Pure Go build successful (no CGO dependencies)
✅ SQLite build successful (with CGO dependencies)
✅ Both binaries start and show help correctly
✅ Integration tests verify all auth and data features
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Deployment Flexibility**: Choose between pure Go or CGO based on needs
2. **Reduced Dependencies**: No C compiler or SQLite libraries required for
   default builds
3. **Better Performance**: PebbleDB optimized for Go applications
4. **Maintainability**: Single codebase supports multiple backends seamlessly
5. **Future-Proof**: Modern UUID-based architecture with legacy compatibility

The project now provides full SQLite feature parity in pure Go builds while
maintaining backward compatibility with existing SQLite deployments.
