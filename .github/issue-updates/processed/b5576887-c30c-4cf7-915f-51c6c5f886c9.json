  "body": "## Description\nRefactor ScanLibraryProgress to avoid second directory walk and use typed store for better performance.\n\n## Current Issues\n- Double directory traversal impacts performance\n- Untyped store causes type safety issues\n- Progress updates can overwhelm the UI\n- Memory usage scales poorly with library size\n\n## Technical Requirements\n- Single-pass directory scanning\n- Typed progress store with interfaces\n- Debounced progress updates\n- Memory-efficient file tracking\n- Concurrent scanning support\n\n## Implementation Plan\n1. Refactor scanner to collect all data in one pass\n2. Implement typed ProgressStore interface\n3. Add progress update debouncing\n4. Optimize memory usage for large libraries\n5. Add concurrent scanning with worker pool\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Library scanning uses single directory traversal\n- [ ] Progress store is fully typed with interfaces\n- [ ] Progress updates are debounced (max 1/second)\n- [ ] Memory usage remains constant regardless of library size\n- [ ] Scanning is at least 50% faster for large libraries\n- [ ] Concurrent scanning improves performance on multi-core systems\n- [ ] Unit tests verify optimization improvements\n- [ ] Benchmarks document performance gains\n\n## Performance Targets\n- Libraries with 10,000+ files scan in < 30 seconds\n- Memory usage < 100MB for any library size\n- CPU usage scales with available cores\n- Progress updates don't impact scan performance\n\n## Testing Requirements\n- Unit tests for progress store\n- Integration tests with various library sizes\n- Performance benchmarks\n- Memory profiling tests\n- Concurrent access tests\n\n<!-- guid:aba846b5-222a-4edd-bccd-95075ba75c0d -->",
