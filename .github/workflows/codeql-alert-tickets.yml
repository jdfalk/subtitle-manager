# DEPRECATED: This workflow has been superseded by unified-issue-management.yml
#
# This file is kept for reference but the functionality has been moved to
# the unified workflow which provides:
# - Enhanced error handling and logging
# - Unified codebase for all issue management operations
# - Better integration with other issue operations
# - Matrix-based parallel execution
# - Comprehensive summary generation
#
# CodeQL alert ticket generation is now handled automatically by the
# unified workflow on schedule and push events.
