# file: .github/workflows/codeql-alert-tickets.yml
#
# This workflow automatically generates GitHub issues for CodeQL security alerts.
#
# Features:
# - Creates tickets for new CodeQL alerts that don't have associated issues
# - Includes detailed alert information (rule, severity, location, etc.)
# - Uses consistent labeling with "security" label
# - Prevents duplicate tickets for the same alert
# - Runs on schedule and when new code is pushed
#
# The workflow integrates with the unified issue management system and
# can be extended to handle alert state changes (resolved, dismissed, etc.)
