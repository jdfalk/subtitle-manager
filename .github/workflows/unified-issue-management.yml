# Migrated Issue Management Workflow (Using Reusable Workflow)
#
# This workflow now uses the centralized reusable workflow from ghcommon
# instead of maintaining its own copy of the issue management logic.
#
# Migration Notes:
# - All functionality is preserved
# - Script is now centrally maintained in ghcommon
# - Configuration is simplified
# - Added advanced scheduling options
