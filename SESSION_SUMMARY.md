# Session Summary: UI Overhaul Completion

## 🎉 Mission Accomplished

The comprehensive UI overhaul for Subtitle Manager has been **successfully completed**. All major objectives outlined in the initial request have been achieved:

### ✅ Original Requirements Met

1. **✅ Show all available subtitle providers (48+) with modern, Bazarr-inspired UI**

   - Dynamic loading from provider registry
   - Professional tile-based interface
   - Enable/disable toggles
   - Configuration dialogs

2. **✅ Redesign settings page with tabbed interface**

   - No more generic text boxes or `[object Object]` values
   - Organized tabs: Providers, General, Database, Authentication, Notifications
   - Provider management as the primary focus

3. **✅ Integrate subtitle extraction and management into media library view**
   - File browser with breadcrumb navigation
   - Subtitle detection and display
   - Bulk operations support
   - No separate extract page needed

### 🚀 Implementation Highlights
