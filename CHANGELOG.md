# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Planned: Hybrid Protobuf + Go Types + gcommon Migration

- We are migrating to a hybrid model for all shared types and business logic:

  - **Protobufs** will define the canonical data models (e.g., LanguageProfile,
    MediaItem, etc.)
  - **Go types** will be generated from Protobufs for use in all Go projects
  - **gcommon** will contain all shared business logic, helpers, and interface
    implementations, importing the generated types
  - **Other languages** (Python, JS, etc.) can generate types from the same
    Protobufs as needed
  - **All work for this migration will be done on the `gcommon-refactor`
    branch**
  - **Main branches** will continue using Go types and type packages until the
    migration is complete

- This approach will:
  - Eliminate duplication and type drift
  - Enable cross-language compatibility
  - Centralize business logic and validation
  - Allow for incremental migration and testing
