## Validation

- ✅ JSON syntax is valid (verified with `python -m json.tool`)
- ✅ All merge conflict markers removed
- ✅ No duplicate keys or structural issues
- ✅ All original data preserved from both branches

## Files Modified

- `/Users/jdfalk/repos/github.com/jdfalk/subtitle-manager/issue_updates.json`

## Impact

The resolved file now properly captures work from both development streams:

1. **Security and Performance Work (HEAD):**
   - OMDB API hostname validation security fixes (#930)
   - Performance benchmarking completion (#532)
   - Provider SDK migration completion (#531)

2. **CI Infrastructure Work (5aa3ba0):**
   - Codecov upload failure handling (#923)
   - CI robustness improvements

This ensures that the unified issue management workflow will process all intended issue operations from both development streams without data loss or conflicts. The workflow can now handle:
- 1 new issue creation (CI-related)
- 7 issue updates (including the new CI fix)
- 7 comments (including CI implementation details)
- 3 issue closures (including CI completion)

All operations maintain their proper GUID-based duplicate prevention and chronological tracking.
