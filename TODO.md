# TODO

This file tracks remaining work and implementation status for Subtitle Manager. **Note: The project is ~85% complete with most core functionality implemented.**

## ðŸŽ¯ Remaining High Priority Tasks

### 1. Complete Web UI (Final 15%)

- [ ] **History Page**: Display translation and download history with filtering
- [ ] **System Page**: Log viewer, task status, system information
- [x] **Wanted Page**: Search for missing subtitles, manage wanted list
- [ ] **File Upload**: Forms for converting/translating uploaded subtitle files

### 2. Missing REST API Endpoints

- [ ] **`/api/download`**: Download subtitles for specific media files
- [x] **`/api/convert`**: Convert uploaded subtitle files between formats
- [ ] **`/api/translate`**: Translate uploaded subtitle files
- [x] **`/api/history`**: Retrieve translation and download history as JSON

### 3. Documentation Updates

- [ ] Update README to reflect current implementation status
- [ ] Mark completed items in roadmap sections
- [ ] Document new REST endpoints and web UI pages

### 4. Remaining Bazarr Features
- [ ] PostgreSQL database backend
- [ ] Reverse proxy base URL support
- [ ] Webhook endpoint for Plex events
- [ ] Anti-captcha service integration
- [ ] Scheduler for Sonarr/Radarr sync and subtitle upgrades

### 5. Bazarr Configuration Import

- [ ] Implement `import-bazarr` command that fetches settings from `/api/system/settings`
  using the user's API key.
- [ ] Map Bazarr preferences for languages, providers and network options into
  the Viper configuration.
- [ ] Document the synchronization process in `docs/BAZARR_SETTINGS_SYNC.md` and
  expose it through the welcome workflow.

## Web Front End Plan

The current React UI includes:

- **Authentication** â€“ Login page with username/password and OAuth2 support
- **Dashboard** â€“ Library scanning with progress tracking and provider selection
- **Settings** â€“ Configuration management with live updates to YAML files
- **Extract** â€“ Subtitle extraction from media files

**Remaining pages to implement:**

- **History** â€“ Combined view of translation and download history with filtering
- **System** â€“ Log viewer, task status, and system information

Additional pages such as blacklist management or per-movie editors can be added once core functionality is complete.

The front end is built with React and Vite under `webui/`. Run `go generate ./webui` to build the single page application which is embedded into the binary and served by the `web` command.

## Additional Documentation

For detailed architecture and design decisions, see `docs/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`.
The file `docs/BAZARR_FEATURES.md` enumerates all Bazarr features - parity has been achieved for providers and core functionality.
