## Web Front End Status

The React UI is **100% complete** and includes all major functionality:

- **Authentication** â€“ Login page with username/password and OAuth2 support
- **Dashboard** â€“ Library scanning with progress tracking and provider selection
- **Settings** â€“ Configuration management with live updates to YAML files
- **Extract** â€“ Subtitle extraction from media files
- **History** â€“ Combined view of translation and download history with language filtering
- **System** â€“ Log viewer, task status, and system information
- **Wanted** â€“ Search interface for missing subtitles with provider selection

All core pages are implemented and fully functional. The front end provides complete feature parity with traditional subtitle management applications.

The front end is built with React and Vite under `webui/`. Run `go generate ./webui` to build the single page application which is embedded into the binary and served by the `web` command.

## Additional Documentation

For detailed architecture and design decisions, see `docs/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`.
The file `docs/BAZARR_FEATURES.md` enumerates all Bazarr features - parity has been achieved for providers and core functionality.
