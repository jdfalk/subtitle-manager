# Issue Enhancement Guide for Junior Developers

## Overview
This document provides guidance for enhancing GitHub issues to be accessible and actionable for junior developers. Each issue should provide comprehensive guidance covering learning objectives, implementation steps, testing requirements, and success criteria.

## Standard Enhancement Structure

### 1. üéØ Learning Objectives  
What skills/concepts will the developer learn by completing this issue?
- **Technical skills**: Specific languages, frameworks, patterns
- **Domain knowledge**: Subtitle processing, media management, etc.  
- **Architecture patterns**: APIs, databases, UI components

### 2. üìö Prerequisites
**Must Read First:** Links to documentation, existing code, and background material
**Understand These Components:** Relevant codebase sections and patterns to study

### 3. üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Guide
**Step-by-step breakdown with timeframes:**
- Step 1: Core implementation (Week X)
- Step 2: API/Integration (Week Y) 
- Step 3: UI Implementation (Week Z)
- Step 4: Testing & Polish (Week W)

**For each step include:**
- Specific files to create/modify
- Code examples and interfaces
- Concrete tasks with acceptance criteria
- Architecture decisions to make

### 4. üß™ Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Specific test files and functions to create
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing
- **Manual Testing Checklist**: Step-by-step verification procedures

## Enhancement Process

1. **Analyze Existing Issue**: Understand current scope and requirements
2. **Add Learning Objectives**: Define what developers will learn
3. **Create Prerequisites Section**: Link to required reading
4. **Develop Implementation Guide**: Break down into weekly phases
5. **Define Testing Strategy**: Specify all required tests
6. **Clarify Acceptance Criteria**: Make requirements testable
7. **Add Getting Started Guide**: Provide setup instructions
8. **Link Related Issues**: Establish relationships
9. **Include Implementation Tips**: Share best practices
10. **Provide Help Resources**: Guide developers to support
