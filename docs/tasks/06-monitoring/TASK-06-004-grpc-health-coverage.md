# TASK-06-004: gRPC health coverage using gcommon

Increase test coverage for health endpoints by wiring and testing gRPC health service consistent with gcommon/health. Related to #1771.

## Goals

- Confirm HealthProvider initialization flows through gRPC registration path
- Add minimal client check using bufconn to hit the gRPC health Check

## Acceptance criteria

- New tests validate gRPC health responds with SERVING when initialized
- HTTP health remains covered (status "up")
- No external network access; all in-memory

## Implementation notes

- If a minimal gRPC server bootstrap isnâ€™t present, add a small helper exclusively for tests
- Keep surface area small; avoid changing production paths unless necessary
