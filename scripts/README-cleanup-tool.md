# Repository Cleanup Tool

Automatically detects and cleans up archived or outdated GitHub repositories from your local
filesystem.

## Features

- üîç **Smart Detection**: Scans directories for Git repositories and checks their GitHub status
- üóÉÔ∏è **Archive Detection**: Identifies archived, disabled, or outdated repositories
- üßπ **Safe Cleanup**: Removes local directories for repositories that are no longer active
- üõ°Ô∏è **Safety First**: Dry-run mode by default, interactive confirmations
- üìä **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logs with timestamps and statistics
- ‚ö° **GitHub Integration**: Uses GitHub CLI for accurate repository status

## Prerequisites

1. **GitHub CLI**: Install from <https://cli.github.com/>
2. **Authentication**: Run `gh auth login` to authenticate
3. **Python 3.7+**: Required for the script execution

## Quick Start

```bash
# Safe dry run (shows what would be done)
./scripts/cleanup-repos.sh

# Interactive cleanup with confirmations
./scripts/cleanup-repos.sh --no-dry-run

# Automated cleanup (no prompts)
./scripts/cleanup-repos.sh --no-dry-run --no-interactive
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Default dry run - safe to run anywhere
python scripts/cleanup-archived-repos.py

# Real cleanup with confirmations
python scripts/cleanup-archived-repos.py --no-dry-run

# Fully automated cleanup
python scripts/cleanup-archived-repos.py --no-dry-run --no-interactive
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
# Custom repository path
python scripts/cleanup-archived-repos.py --path ~/my-projects

# Verbose logging
python scripts/cleanup-archived-repos.py --verbose

# Different base directory
python scripts/cleanup-archived-repos.py --path /Users/username/code
```

## What Gets Removed

The tool identifies repositories for removal based on:

1. **Archived repositories** - Marked as archived on GitHub
2. **Disabled repositories** - Disabled due to policy violations
3. **Stale repositories** - Not updated in over 2 years

## Safety Features

- ‚úÖ **Dry Run Default**: Shows what would be done without making changes
- ‚úÖ **Interactive Mode**: Prompts for confirmation before each removal
- ‚úÖ **Detailed Logging**: All actions logged with timestamps
- ‚úÖ **GitHub Verification**: Checks actual GitHub status, not just local state
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network issues and API limits

## Command Line Options

| Option             | Description                    | Default                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `--path PATH`      | Base directory to scan         | `~/repos/github.com/jdfalk` |
| `--dry-run`        | Show actions without executing | `True`                      |
| `--no-dry-run`     | Actually perform cleanup       | -                           |
| `--interactive`    | Prompt for confirmations       | `True`                      |
| `--no-interactive` | Run without prompts            | -                           |
| `--verbose`        | Enable debug logging           | `False`                     |

## Log Files

All operations are logged to timestamped files in `~/logs/`:

- `repo-cleanup-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`

Logs include:

- Repository scan results
- GitHub API responses
- Actions taken or simulated
- Error details and statistics
- Final summary report

## Error Handling

The tool handles various error conditions gracefully:

- **Network issues**: Retries with exponential backoff
- **API rate limits**: Respects GitHub API limits
- **Authentication failures**: Clear error messages
- **File system errors**: Detailed error logging
- **Interrupted operations**: Clean exit with partial results

## Contributing

1. Test thoroughly with `--dry-run` first
2. Add new repository detection criteria carefully
3. Maintain backward compatibility
4. Update documentation for new features
5. Follow existing code style and patterns

## Safety Notice

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Always run with `--dry-run` first to see what would be removed!

This tool permanently deletes local directories. While it has safety features, you should:

1. Backup important work before running
2. Review the dry-run output carefully
3. Understand what each repository contains
4. Use version control for important projects

The tool only removes local directories - it never touches your GitHub repositories online.
